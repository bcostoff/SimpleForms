# SimpleForms
Easily insert form data into a database.

Please note that this script only works if both the table name and unique primary id have the same prefixed name. See below for example:

Table Name = user   WHERE  Unique Primary Id = user_id 

or 

Table Name = locations   WHERE   Unique Primary Id = locations_id
