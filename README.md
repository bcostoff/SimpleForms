# SimpleForms
Easily insert form data into a database.

Please note that this script only works if both the table name and unique primary id have the same prefixed name. See below for example:

Table Name -> user 
Unique Primary Id -> user_id 

or 

Table Name -> locations
Unique Primary Id -> locations_id
